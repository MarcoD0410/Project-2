## Challenges

Biggest challenge that I couldn't get was the layout.liquid tried everything I could think of im sure it was something easy as well but I couldn't get it work

The carosal was another big challenge I couldn't overcome even after watching the class recording from that day just gave me a lot of trouble 

Being able to style better, styling took a lot of my time and I didnt even get to do what I had in mind because it didn't come out the way I wanted
